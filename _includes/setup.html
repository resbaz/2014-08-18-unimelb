<h3>Bash shell</h3>
<p>
  Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
  more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
  computer.
</p>

<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
  Install Git for Windows by downloading and running
  <a href="https://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.8.4-preview20130916.exe">the installer</a>.
  This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
</p>

<h5>Mac</h5>
<p>
  The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash,
  so no need to install anything. You access bash from
  the Terminal (found
  in <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>). You may want
  to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
</p>

<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
  The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>,
  but if your machine is set up differently
  you can run it by opening a terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.
  There is no need to install anything.
</p>

<h3>Text editor</h3>
<p>
  When you're writing code (e.g. for executing bash commands), it's nice to 
  have a text editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
  like automatic color-coding of key words.
  The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
  which is not famous for being intuitive. If you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
  try typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
  then hitting Return to return to the shell.
</p>

<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
  <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
  popular free code editor for Windows.
  Be aware that you must add its installation directory to your system path
  in order to launch it by typing "notepad" at the command line
  (or have other tools like Git launch it for you).
  Please ask your instructor to help you do this.
</p>

<h5>Mac</h5>
<p>
  We recommend
  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
  <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
  In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>, which should be pre-installed.
</p>

<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
  <a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for Linux users.
  In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>, which should be pre-installed.
</p>

<h3>Git</h3>
<p>
  Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
  lets you track who made changes to what when and has
  options for easily updating a shared or public version of
  your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
</p>

<h5>Windows</h5>
<p>
  See instructions for the bash shell above.
</p>

<h5>Mac</h5>
<p>
  Install Git for Mac by download and running
  <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">the installer</a>.
</p>

<h5>Linux</h5>
<p>
  If Git is not already available on your machine you can try
  to install it via your distro's package manager
  (e.g. <code>apt-get</code>).
</p>

<h3>Matlab</h3>

<p>
  Matlab is a very popular data analysis environment. It's a commercial product,
  however most universities provide free licences to their staff
  and students. University of Melbourne people can find instructions on
  how to install Matlab on their personal laptop 
  <a href="https://github.com/resbaz/lessons/blob/master/matlab/unimelb_matlab_install.md">here</a>.
  Participants from other institutions should ask their IT department for assistance.
</p>
<p>
  During the installation process, you''ll be asked whether you'd like to install
  any additional toolboxes (e.g. statistics, curve fitting, aerospace... there are many).
  No specialised toolboxes are required to complete the bootcamp, however if there are
  toolboxes that look relevant to your research, you may wish to install them for
  future use. Note that it's not a good idea to install all the available toolboxes, as 
  this makes the installation process take much longer (i.e. don't install a toolbox 
  unless you are very likely to use it - you can always install additional toolboxes 
  later on).
